# Surface
* Uses sympy, matplotlib and numpy
* Default surfaces such as cylinder, helicoid, torus, mobiusStrip (might take time!), sphere, pseudosphere, saddle, revolution surfaces, ruled surfaces, cateboid, planes
* Computes and plots tangent planes
* Displays surfaces, computes first and second fundamental forms
* Computes gauss and mean curvature
* Detects if the surface is conform or minimal
* Displays 2d curves, computes curvature and osculating circle
